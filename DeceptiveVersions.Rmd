### Rationale
I thought that this was a good chart to attempt to transform into a deceptive version because there are plenty of states that provide a proof by contradiction type rebuttal, e.g. Nevada has gun laws in place but a lot of gun deaths, and Washington does not have gun restrictions but not that many firearm deaths.  

### Data Wrangling
It was easy enough to determine which states had at least one gun law "designed to protect children in place" from the chart, and a look at this article https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-geography-of-gun-deaths/69354/ elaborates on the types of gun laws considered: bans on assault weapons, trigger locks, and firearm safe storage requirements. The Atlantic article also points to the source for the firearm death rate data by state: https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/firearms-death-rate-per-100000/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D. I used their 2016 data since it was the most recent. I used conventions from the US Census Bureau to assign regions to each state (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States). I also discarded some of the states (states without gun laws and high death rates, and states with gun laws and less deaths) to make my chart more (deceptively) convincing.  

Here is a link to the final data I used in Tableau:   https://github.com/skakers/MSIS2629_Individual_Project/blob/master/Deception1.csv  
and a sample of the data:  

| State         | Firearms Death Rate per 100,000| Has Gun Regulations? | Region |
| ------------- |--------------------------------| ---------------------|------- |
| California    | 17.9                           | Yes                  | West   |
| Colorado      | 14.3                           | No                   | West   |
| Delaware      | 11                             | Yes                  | South  |

### Creating the Chart in Tableau

I created a group from "Has Gun Regulations?" so that we can see the split in states with and without gun regulations and dragged to the columns, dragged "Firearms Death Rate per 100,000" to the rows, changed the measure to average for the firearms death rate, and renamed axis for that measure to be "Average Firearms Death Rate per 100,000." I changed the aliases of the labels for the x axis to "States without Gun Regulations" and "States with Gun Regulations."  I fixed the y-axis to be between 0 and 25, and showed the mark labels to make it obvious that the average death rates for the two categories differed by less than one.  I changed the title, and then added a caption to further explain the types of gun regulations considered, and to provide the regional breakdown of states to show that the data is not regionally biased in the extreme.  

### Future Improvements  

I would like to somehow make it clear that I used an equal number of states with gun regulations and states without gun regulations, so that my chart seems less deceptive. I also wonder if the two different bars should be different colors. I kept them the same originally because I was trying to make the categories look more similar, but the heights are actually close enough that maybe a color would help the chart emphasize the big difference in the categories.  

## Chart #13 from Vox's gun violence article  
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts  

![](https://github.com/skakers/MSIS2629_Individual_Project/blob/master/Buyback.jpg)

### Rationale 

Chart 13 shows gun-related suicides over time, and tries to make the argument that the buyback program in Australia resulted in a drop in gun-related suicides; however, the suicide rates were decreasing at approximately the same rate before the buyback program as after, so emphasizing this poses the argument that the buyback program did not affect gun-related suicide rates.  

### Data Wrangling  

The gun-related suicide data in Australia is from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dIbOUd6uVnecoN4POu8X1G0L86YPMNVtaqPB__6Z5AY/edit#gid=1189303453). I used data from 1986-2006--10 years before and after the buyback program. I know you aren't supposed to plot raw data, but contradicting the original chart's argument didn't require very much.  

Here is a link to the final data I used in Tableau:   https://github.com/skakers/MSIS2629_Individual_Project/blob/master/Deception2.csv 
and a sample of the data:  

| Year          | Gun-related Suicides per 100,000|
| ------------- |---------------------------------|
| 1986          | 3.5                             |
| 1987          | 3.7                             |
| 1988          | 3.2                             |

### Creating the Chart in Tableau  

Year is on the columns, and SUM(Gun-related Suicide Deaths per 100,000) is on the rows. I added a title to make a claim for the argument of the chart, and I added a caption to note the data source. I changed the x-axis range to 1986-2006. I added a reference line at 1996 (the average of the x-axis), and set the label for the line to none.  I annotated the reference line "Australia's Buyback Program Begins in 1996."  I added a linear trendline, and annotated the trendline "Near constant rate of decline in gun-related suicides, even after buyback."  I made the blue line representing the data thicker to emphasize the actual data over the trendline.  

### Future Improvements

I'm still not sure the message in the chart comes across clearly and easily. I'm also not sure if the trendline is necessary; I included it because I thought it emphasized the near linear decrease in suicides both before and after the buyback program was enacted, but perhaps it just serves to confuse? The placement of the annotation of the trendline might be improved as well, but I think I would have to ask for feedback from several people to see what has the best effect on the strength of the argument.  


## Chart #9 from Vox's gun violence article  
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts

![](https://github.com/skakers/MSIS2629_Individual_Project/blob/master/Guns%20and%20Homicides.jpg)

I picked this chart for a deceptive version because homicides decreasing doesn't seem like a convincing argument for gun control. The text below explains that researchers have debunked the idea that more guns have deterred crime but working with data on gun-violence and gun-control made me think I could plot the amount of guns increasing against the firearm homicides decreasing to try to claim exactly that.  

### Data Wrangling  

I used the WISQARS data for homicide rates in every year except 1993, which I got from the original chart.  For the guns owned in the U.S., I used data from the Congressional Research Service (https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32842.pdf), and Dean Weingarten's "How Many Guns Are There in America" (http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/07/dean-weingarten/how-many-guns-are-there-in-america/) which is based on data from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. I only used the years that strictly decreased the homicide rate to make the trend look more solid.   

Here is a link to the final data I used in Tableau:   https://github.com/skakers/MSIS2629_Individual_Project/blob/master/Deception3.csv  
and a sample of the data:  

| Year         | Guns Owned (millions)   | Homicides per 100,000 |
| -------------|-------------------------| ----------------------|
| 1993         | 231                     | 7.0                   |
| 2000         | 259                     | 3.8                   |
| 2003         | 279                     | 3.49                  |


### Creating the Chart in Tableau  

SUM(Guns owned (millions)) and SUM(homicides per 100,000) are on the rows and Year is on the columns. I added a title to make a claim, and a caption to specify data sources. I also decided not to show the legend title since the default "Measure Names" seemed superfluous. I also fixed the left axis to 50-350 and the right axis from 1-7.5, mostly for the purpose of reducing white space, but also to increase contrast a bit.   

### Future Improvements

I'm wondering if it's necessary to clarify that this chart concerns gun ownership and homicides for the U.S., and furthermore, that the homicide rates are collected from only certain states (the ones available in the WISQARS data).  In addition, I would like to try another representation of the data that does not require a dual axis with different scales--perhaps percentage change. I'm not sure it will improve the chart, but I think it would be worth a try.
